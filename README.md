Welcome to my data visualization showcase! This is where I display some of the things that I have learned over the years. If you have any questions or would like any clarification, feel free to message me.

Data Visualization Showcase Excel 
  - This file is meant to show my experience with Microsoft Excel, pivot tables, and displaying data through graphs. 
  - I used the Javascript API to organize and name the data, which then allowed me to sort it by type.

I worked through "ServiceNow" during this period in my career, creating dashboards and using the data on the site to lead company processes at Global Services.

Word Iteration.py
  - This file is a small project that I designed to iterate through letters to show a message, almost in the style of the matrix.

ResumeDecoder.py
 - This was a project that I was asked to complete during a resume. It takes data from a website, and takes the table and formats it into data. From there, it takes coordinates to display a code.
